    <!--Exercise 10: 
There are different ways to highlight text. 
Try to put a few words of the text in bold or italic letters and also use the mark-tag on one. 
Try to find out, what the difference between "bold" and "strong", "italic" and "emphasis" is. 
When would you use which of these elements? Browsers display <strong> as <b>, and <em> as <i>. However, 
there is a difference in the meaning of these tags: <b> and <i> defines bold and italic text, but <strong> 
  and <em> means that the text is "important".

      <h3>Tawny owl</h3>
      <p>
        The tawny owl or brown owl (Strix aluco) is a stocky, medium-sized owl
        commonly found in <i>woodlands</i> across much of Eurasia. The tawny owl is a
        member of the genus Strix, that is also the origin of the family's name
        under >Linnaean taxonomy. <strong>Its underparts are pale with dark streaks, and
        the upperparts are either brown or grey.</strong> Several of the eight recognised
        subspecies have both. This nocturnal bird of prey hunts a wide variety
        of prey species, but usually primarily takes small mammals such as
        rodents. Tawny owls usually hunt by dropping from a perch to seize their
        prey, which they <b>typically</b> swallows whole. In more urban areas, its diet
        includes a higher proportion of birds, while in <em>arid subtropics many
        invertebrates</em> such as insects are taken.
